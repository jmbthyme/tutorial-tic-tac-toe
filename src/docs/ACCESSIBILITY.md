# Accessibility Features

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility features implemented in the React Tic-Tac-Toe application to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and excellent screen reader support.

## Overview

The application has been designed with accessibility as a core principle, implementing comprehensive keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, screen reader support, and focus management throughout the entire user interface.

## Keyboard Navigation

### Game Board Navigation

- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between squares on the game board
  - Up/Down arrows: Move vertically between rows
  - Left/Right arrows: Move horizontally between columns
  - Navigation wraps around edges (e.g., pressing left on the first square moves to the last square)
- **Home Key**: Jump to the first square (top-left)
- **End Key**: Jump to the last square (bottom-right)
- **Enter/Space**: Make a move on the currently focused square
- **Tab**: Navigate between major UI elements (board, history buttons, reset button)

### Global Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Escape**: Reset the game and start over
- **Ctrl/Cmd + R**: Alternative reset shortcut (prevented from refreshing page)

### History Navigation

- **Tab**: Navigate through move history buttons
- **Enter/Space**: Jump to a specific move in the game history

## ARIA Attributes and Semantic HTML

### Game Board

- `role="group"`: Identifies the game board as a grouped set of controls
- `aria-label="Tic-tac-toe game board, 3 by 3 grid"`: Descriptive label for screen readers
- `aria-describedby="game-instructions"`: Links to keyboard navigation instructions
- `aria-live="polite"`: Announces board state changes to screen readers
- `aria-atomic="false"`: Only announces changed parts of the board

### Individual Squares

- `role="button"`: Semantic button role for interactive squares
- `aria-label`: Dynamic labels describing square state:
  - Empty: "Empty square, click to place your mark"
  - Filled: "Square filled with X/O"
  - Winning: "Square filled with X/O, winning square"
- `aria-pressed`: Indicates whether a square has been selected (true/false)
- `aria-describedby`: Links winning squares to additional description
- `tabindex`: Proper tab order management (0 for focusable, -1 for disabled)

### Game Status

- `role="status"`: Live region for game state announcements
- `aria-live="polite"`: Announces status changes without interrupting user
- `aria-atomic="true"`: Announces complete status message
- `aria-label`: Detailed status for screen readers:
  - Active game: "Game in progress. It is X's turn."
  - Game over: "Game over. X wins the game." or "Game over. The game is a draw."

### History Section

- `role="complementary"`: Identifies as supplementary content
- `aria-labelledby="history-title"`: Links to section heading
- `role="region"`: Groups move history navigation
- `role="list"` and `role="listitem"`: Proper list semantics for move history
- `aria-current="step"`: Indicates current move in history

### Navigation and Landmarks

- `role="main"`: Main game content area
- `<aside>` element: Semantic sidebar for game history
- Skip link: "Skip to game board" for keyboard users
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2) for screen reader navigation

## Screen Reader Support

### Live Regions

- Game status changes are announced automatically
- Board state changes are communicated politely
- Game over states trigger assertive announcements

### Hidden Instructions

Screen reader users receive comprehensive instructions that are visually hidden:

- Keyboard navigation instructions for the game board
- Detailed descriptions of game state and available actions
- Keyboard shortcut information

### Descriptive Content

- All interactive elements have meaningful labels
- Game state is clearly communicated
- Winning combinations are explicitly identified
- Move history provides context for each game state

## Focus Management

### Visual Focus Indicators

- Clear focus rings on all interactive elements
- High contrast focus indicators that meet WCAG standards
- Focus styles work in high contrast mode

### Focus Flow

- Logical tab order through the interface
- Focus is maintained when game state changes
- Focus returns to appropriate elements after actions
- Disabled elements are removed from tab order

### Focus Restoration

- Focus is managed when navigating through game history
- Reset actions restore focus to the game board
- Game over states provide clear focus targets

## Color and Contrast

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

- All text meets minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Interactive elements have sufficient contrast
- Focus indicators meet enhanced contrast requirements (3:1)

### High Contrast Mode Support

- Application works properly in Windows High Contrast mode
- Custom high contrast styles for better visibility
- Focus indicators remain visible in all contrast modes

### Color Independence

- Information is not conveyed through color alone
- Winning states use both color and text indicators
- Game state is communicated through multiple channels

## Responsive Design and Touch

### Touch Targets

- All interactive elements meet minimum touch target size (44x44px)
- Adequate spacing between touch targets
- Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile devices

### Responsive Behavior

- Accessibility features work across all screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation adapts to different layouts
- Screen reader support is consistent across devices

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Boundaries

- Graceful error handling with accessible error messages
- Clear recovery options for users
- Error states are announced to screen readers

### Input Validation

- Invalid moves are prevented rather than causing errors
- Clear feedback for unavailable actions
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

- jest-axe integration for automated accessibility testing
- Comprehensive test coverage for all accessibility features
- Regular validation against WCAG guidelines

### Manual Testing

- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- High contrast mode validation
- Mobile accessibility testing

## Browser and Assistive Technology Support

### Screen Readers

- NVDA (Windows)
- JAWS (Windows)
- VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- TalkBack (Android)

### Browsers

- Chrome/Chromium
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Keyboard Navigation

- Full keyboard support in all major browsers
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Support for browser-specific accessibility features

## Implementation Details

### React Accessibility Patterns

- Proper use of React ARIA props
- Semantic HTML elements where appropriate (following ESLint jsx-a11y rules)
- Custom hooks for accessibility state management
- Memoization to prevent unnecessary screen reader announcements
- Compliance with ESLint jsx-a11y plugin rules:
  - No redundant roles on semantic elements
  - No autoFocus usage to prevent accessibility issues
  - Proper ARIA attribute usage

### CSS Accessibility Features

- Screen reader only content (`.sr-only` class)
- Focus management styles
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion support for users with vestibular disorders

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient ARIA updates to minimize screen reader chatter
- Optimized focus management to prevent performance issues
- Lazy loading of accessibility descriptions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- Voice control support
- Additional keyboard shortcuts
- Customizable accessibility preferences
- Enhanced mobile screen reader support

### Ongoing Maintenance

- Regular accessibility audits
- User feedback integration
- Updates for new WCAG guidelines
- Compatibility testing with new assistive technologies

This comprehensive accessibility implementation ensures that the Tic-Tac-Toe game is usable by all users, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.
