# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring an existing React tic-tac-toe application to follow modern React best practices and industry standards. The current implementation is a functional tutorial-based application that needs to be modernized with TypeScript, improved component architecture, modern styling approaches, comprehensive testing, accessibility features, and performance optimizations while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to use TypeScript, so that I can benefit from type safety, better IDE support, and reduced runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is converted to TypeScript THEN all JavaScript files SHALL be converted to TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. WHEN TypeScript is implemented THEN all component props SHALL have proper type interfaces
3. WHEN TypeScript is implemented THEN all functions SHALL have proper return type annotations
4. WHEN TypeScript is implemented THEN the project SHALL compile without TypeScript errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved component architecture, so that the code is more maintainable, reusable, and follows React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are refactored THEN each component SHALL be in its own file with proper exports
2. WHEN components are refactored THEN custom hooks SHALL be extracted for game logic
3. WHEN components are refactored THEN components SHALL use proper React patterns like composition over inheritance
4. WHEN components are refactored THEN utility functions SHALL be separated into dedicated modules
5. WHEN components are refactored THEN constants SHALL be extracted to separate configuration files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern CSS styling approaches, so that the application has better maintainability and follows current CSS best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is modernized THEN CSS modules or styled-components SHALL be implemented for component-scoped styling
2. WHEN CSS is modernized THEN CSS Grid or Flexbox SHALL replace float-based layouts
3. WHEN CSS is modernized THEN CSS custom properties (variables) SHALL be used for consistent theming
4. WHEN CSS is modernized THEN responsive design principles SHALL be applied

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the application is reliable and regressions can be prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL be written for all components using React Testing Library
2. WHEN testing is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL be written for all custom hooks
3. WHEN testing is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL be written for all utility functions
4. WHEN testing is implemented THEN integration tests SHALL cover complete game scenarios
5. WHEN testing is implemented THEN test coverage SHALL be at least 90%

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be accessible, so that I can use the tic-tac-toe game with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility is implemented THEN all interactive elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels
2. WHEN accessibility is implemented THEN keyboard navigation SHALL work for all game controls
3. WHEN accessibility is implemented THEN screen readers SHALL be able to announce game state changes
4. WHEN accessibility is implemented THEN color contrast SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. WHEN accessibility is implemented THEN focus management SHALL be properly handled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimizations, so that the application runs efficiently and follows React performance best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance is optimized THEN React.memo SHALL be used appropriately to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN performance is optimized THEN useCallback and useMemo SHALL be used where beneficial
3. WHEN performance is optimized THEN component re-renders SHALL be minimized through proper state management
4. WHEN performance is optimized THEN the application SHALL maintain smooth user interactions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and development tools, so that debugging and maintenance are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN error boundaries SHALL catch and handle component errors gracefully
2. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN proper error messages SHALL be displayed to users
3. WHEN development tools are added THEN ESLint SHALL be configured with React and TypeScript rules
4. WHEN development tools are added THEN Prettier SHALL be configured for consistent code formatting
5. WHEN development tools are added THEN Husky SHALL be configured for pre-commit hooks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing game functionality preserved, so that users can continue to play tic-tac-toe as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all original game features SHALL continue to work identically
2. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN game history navigation SHALL work as before
3. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN winner detection SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the visual appearance SHALL be maintained or improved
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all user interactions SHALL behave as expected
